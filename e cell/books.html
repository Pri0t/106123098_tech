            <h3>City of girls</h3>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Elizabeth Gilbert</p>
            <p><strong>Narrated by:</strong>Blair Brown</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong>15 hrs 8 mins</p>
            <p><strong>Categorie:</strong>Literature & Fiction</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><p>The blazingly brilliant new novel from Elizabeth Gilbert, author of the international best seller Eat Pray Love: a glittering coming-of-age epic stitched across the fabric of a lost New York.
            </p>
               <p>It is the summer of 1940. Nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris arrives in New York with her suitcase and sewing machine, exiled by her despairing parents. Although her quicksilver talents with a needle and commitment to mastering the perfect hair roll have been deemed insufficient for her to pass into her sophomore year of Vassar, she soon finds gainful employment as the self-appointed seamstress at the Lily Playhouse, her unconventional Aunt Peg's charmingly disreputable Manhattan revue theatre. There, Vivian quickly becomes the toast of the showgirls, transforming the trash and tinsel only fit for the cheap seats into creations for goddesses.</p> 
                
               <p> Exile in New York is no exile at all: here in this strange wartime city of girls, Vivian and her girlfriends mean to be free, to get up to no good, to drink the heady highball of life itself to the last drop. And when the legendary English actress Edna Watson comes to the Lily to star in the company's most ambitious show ever, Vivian is entranced by the magic that follows in the wake of this true, true star.</p>
                
                <p>But there are hard lessons to be learned and bitterly regrettable mistakes to be made. Vivian learns that to live the life she wants, she must live many lives, ceaselessly and ingeniously making them new.</p>
                
               <p>'At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time. After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is,' she confides. And so Vivian sets forth her story, and that of the women around her - women who have lived as they truly are, out of step with a century that could never quite keep up with them.</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> David Goggins</p>
            <p><strong>Narrated by:</strong>David Goggins, Adam Skolnick</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong>13 hrs 37 mins</p>
            <p><strong>Categorie:</strong> Parenting & Relationships</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><p>New York Times best-seller. Over five million copies sold
            </p>
               <p>For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare--poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a US Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force tactical air controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him the Fittest (Real) Man in America.</p> 
                
               <p>In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40 percent of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential. </p>
                
                <p>An annotated edition of Can't Hurt Me, offering over two hours of bonus content featuring deeper insights and never-before-told stories shared by David. Not available in other formats.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><p>Eleanor Oliphant has learned how to survive – but not how to live
            </p>
               <p>Eleanor Oliphant leads a simple life. She wears the same clothes to work every day, eats the same meal deal for lunch every day and buys the same two bottles of vodka to drink every weekend.</p> 
                
               <p>Eleanor Oliphant is happy. Nothing is missing from her carefully timetabled life. Except, sometimes, everything.</p>
                
                <p>One simple act of kindness is about to shatter the walls Eleanor has built around herself. Now she must learn how to navigate the world that everyone else seems to take for granted – while searching for the courage to face the dark corners she’s avoided all her life.</p>
                
               <p>Change can be good. Change can be bad. But surely any change is better than… fine?</p>

               <p>

                Rumors about the Swamp Girl circulated for many years in Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the coast of North Carolina. So, in 1969, when the handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect that he was killed by Kya Clark, the real name of the Swamp Girl. But Kya is nowhere near the wilderness the world imagines.
                
               
                
                </p> 
                
               <p> Sensitive and intelligent, she survived alone in the lush vegetation marshes of the oceanshore, befriending seagulls, discovering the endless richness of canal-strewn forests and learning life lessons accessible only to those who live in nature. One day, Kya feels the desire to be loved in her soul, and when two young people from the city are attracted by her unusual beauty, her life changes completely, taking on another meaning.</p>

                <p><strong>Author:</strong>Kalki</p>
                <p><strong>Narrated by:</strong>Bombay Kannan</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong>14 hrs</p>
                <p><strong>Categorie:</strong>Fiction</p>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong><p>Ponniyin Selvan is a historical novel by Kalki Krishnamurthy, written in Tamil. In five volumes, it tells the story of early days of Arulmozhivarman, who later became the great Chola emperor Rajaraja Chola I. The book took more than three years to write; Kalki visited Sri Lanka three times to gather information for it.
                </p>
                   <p>Ponniyin Selvan is widely considered by many to be the greatest novel ever written in Tamil literature. It was first published as a series in the Kalki, a Tamil language magazine, during the 1950s and was later integrated into a novel. The craze for the series, which was published weekly, was such that it elevated the magazine circulation to reach a staggering figure of 71,366 copies - no mean achievement in a newly independent India.</p> 
                    
                   <p>Even today, the novel has a cult following and fan base among people of all generations. The book continues to be admired and garner critical acclaim for its tightly woven plot and vivid narration, the wit of the dialogue, and the way in which the power struggle and intrigues of the Chola empire were depicted.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>Penguin presents the audiobook edition of Ask Again, Yes by Mary Beth Keane.
            </p>
               <p>Gillam, upstate New York: a town of ordinary, big-lawned suburban houses. The Gleesons have recently moved there and soon welcome the Stanhopes as their new neighbours. Lonely Lena Gleeson wants a friend but Anne Stanhope - cold, elegant, unstable - wants to be left alone.</p> 
                
               <p>It's left to their children - Lena's youngest, Kate, and Anne's only child, Peter - to find their way to one another. To form a friendship whose resilience and love will be almost broken by the fault line dividing both families, and by the terrible tragedy that will engulf them all. A tragedy whose true origins only become clear many years later....</p>
                
                <p>A story of love and redemption, faith and forgiveness, Ask Again, Yes reveals the way childhood memories change when viewed from the distance of adulthood - villains lose their menace, and those who appeared innocent seem less so. A story of how, if we're lucky, the violence lurking beneath everyday life can be vanquished by the power of love.

            <p><strong>Author:</strong>Ocean Vuong </p>
            <p><strong>Narrated by:</strong>Ocean Voung</p>

            <p><strong>Categorie:</strong>LGBTQ+</p>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><p>Penguin presents the audiobook edition of On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, written and read by Ocean Vuong.
            </p>
               <p>
                Brilliant, heartbreaking, tender, and highly original – poet Ocean Vuong's debut novel is a sweeping and shattering portrait of a family, and a testament to the redemptive power of storytelling</p> 
                
               <p>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born – a history whose epicentre is rooted in Vietnam – and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to the American moment, immersed as it is in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.</p>
                
                <p>With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.
